## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Create, view, and manage assignments
- Submit assignments
- Review and grade assignments
- User roles: Students and Instructors

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: MySQL

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL

## Installation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment-submission-app.git
    cd assignment-submission-app/backend
    ```

2. **Configure the MySQL database:**
    Create a MySQL database named `assignment_submission_db` and update the database configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/assignment_submission_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
    ```

3. **Build and run the backend:**
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Frontend (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The React application will run on `http://localhost:3000` and the Spring Boot backend will run on `http://localhost:8081`.

## Running the Application
Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

## Configuration
### Backend Configuration
The backend configurations are primarily located in the `application.properties` file. You can adjust the database connection settings, server port, and other Spring Boot configurations as needed.

### Frontend Configuration
For API calls, the frontend uses Axios. The base URL for the API is set in the service files. Ensure the URLs match your backend endpoints.

## Usage
1. **Register an account**: Sign up as a new user.
2. **Login**: Log in with your credentials.
3. **Role-based access**:
    - **Students** can view and submit assignments.
    - **Instructors** can create, review, and grade assignments.
